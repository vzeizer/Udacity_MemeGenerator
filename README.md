# Udacity - Nanodegree Intermediate Python - Project 2

# Project - Motivational Meme Generator

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a "meme generator", which consists of a multimedia application to dynamically generate memes, including an image with an overlaid quote.
We worked on several types of files, such as, pdf, docx, csv and txt. 
All the programs are written modularly by using packages, and class methods are used whenever possible.
The code is clearly written and follows the PEP8 requirements.
We make available the options of running the application locally, or to deploy locally a flask application.
Moreover, you can run the application in the web by using our provided Heroku application, as it will be shown below.

Hope you enjoy as I have enjoyed doing it! :)

## Requirements

The following packages (i.e., libraries) are necessary to successfully run this project on your local machine:

1. See file requirements.txt

### Roles and Responsabilities of the main sub-modules

1. Flask: micro web framework, used to create an app
2. gunicorn: it is a pure-Python HTTP server for WSGI applications.
3. numpy: to do array calculations
4. pandas: to load csv
5. Pillow: to manipulate images
6. python-docx: to handle docx files
7. requests: to make HTTP requests simpler and easier to handle

Note: You must install locally the xpdf package for your OS.

# Local installation

Simply clone this repo and run "pip install requirements.txt".

## Running the programs

1. to run locally: python3 meme.py

2. to create a flask application locally: python3 app.py

3. to use deployed (Heroku) version of the app, visit: [here](https://multicultural-crown-56632.herokuapp.com/)
